Took my Project 1 for CSE 2221 at The Ohio State University and added my own twist to the project

Uses the Ohio State CSE Components, so this only works if you have that setup
You can create a new project with those libraries and add the java file here to the project
The code uses a text file as input, so make sure there is a text file the program can access

When you run the code:
Enter the text file you would like to use. I have a file called gettysburg.txt that you can copy to
your project folder, so you can enter gettysburg.txt when prompted
Then, enter the name of the output file you want, though it should be saved as a .html file (i.e. gettysburg.html)
The program then prompts you if you want a boring output. If you say yes or something similar, the html file will
produce a boring table with the counts of all the words
If you type anything else, the output is what I spent 95% of my time on, so hopefully enjoy.
